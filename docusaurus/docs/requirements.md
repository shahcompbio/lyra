## Assumptions

1. Tree data will contain cells within leaf nodes, not internal
2. Minimum screen size is 1280x800

## Functional

1. [[Stories](us-analyses.md)] Support visualization of results from a number of analyses
2. [[Stories](us-tree.md)] Tree representation for thousands of cells
3. [[Stories](us-heatmap.md)] Heatmap (CN, SNV, breakpoint, corrupt tree output) accompanies tree

## Non-Functional

1. Responsive and real-time interactions
2. Views are able to be compartmentalized
3. Unit tests
4. Flexible to different screen sizes larger than the minimum.
