- To create a single cell phylogenetics dashboard

## Background and strategic fit

As more and more cells get sequenced, once immediate analysis that can be done is to see how these cells are related to one another. However, these trees often consist of thousands of cells, and current visualizations do not support drawing to this scale and retaining some level of interactivity.

We have done a prototype of a tree and copy number heatmap visualization, that scales to thousands of cells. As more users adopt it, we have taken their feedback and feature requests and will aim to get a new version released.
